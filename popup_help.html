 <div id="remainder_guidelines" class="help_window">
	<h1>About custom remainders</h1>
	<p>
		Custom remainders (suffixes) should be unique and opaque. By opaque,
		it is meant that the alphanumeric string has no meaning.
		EZID strongly discourages placing brand strings in the
		remainder because successor organizations do not often honor
		previous brand and name assignments.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because it is difficult to do this manually, it is
		recommended that EZID generate new identifiers in
		order to guarantee that they are unique and opaque.

<div id="public_id_help" class="help_window">
	<h1>About identifier publication</h1>
	<p>
		Publication of an identifier means making the identifier,
		its target URL and associate metadata publicly available.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="coowners_help" class="help_window">
	<h1>About co-ownership</h1>
	<p>
		Co-ownership is when one EZID user account designates another
		EZID user account as co-owner of the first account's identifiers.
		This gives the second EZID user account the right to manage
		and edit detailed information about an identifier.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="disabled_edit_help" class="help_window">
	<h1>Why is the edit button disabled?</h1>
	<p>
		This identifier is currently editable only
		through the EZID API.
	</p>
</div>
