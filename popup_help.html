 <div id="remainder_guidelines" class="help_window">
	<h1>About custom remainders</h1>
	<p>
		Custom remainders (suffixes) should be unique and opaque. By opaque,
		it is meant that the alphanumeric string has no meaning.
		EZID strongly discourages placing brand strings in the
		remainder because successor organizations do not often honor
		previous brand and name assignments.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because it is difficult to do this manually, it is
		recommended that EZID generate new identifiers in
		order to guarantee that they are unique and opaque.  
	</p>
</div>

<div id="public_id_help" class="help_window">
	<h1>Status</h1>
	<p>
		<strong>public</strong>: the identifier is viewable by anyone.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>reserved</strong>: the identifier is known only to EZID. May be used
		to reserve an identifier name within EZID without advertising
		the identifier's existence to resolvers and other external services. May be deleted.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>unavailable</strong>: The identifier is public, but only insofar as it
		redirects to an EZID-provided "tombstone" page, displaying the identifier's
		citation metadata and the reason for the object's unavailability.

<div id="unavail_reason_help" class="help_window">
	<h1>Reason for Unavailability</h1>
	<p>
		The reason you supply will appear on the identifier's manage page,

		(an HTML page that displays the identifier's citation metadata and
		the reason for the object's unavailability) regardless of its target URL.

		and edit detailed information about an identifier.
