	<h2>My Account</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>Set up an account.</dt> 
		<dd>To set up an account with EZID, please visit the
			<a href="/ezid/contact">contact us</a> page and send
			us an email inquiry.
		</dd>
		<dt>Edit account information</dt>
		<dd>
			Once you have an EZID account, you can edit your name, address,
			phone number, and password on the My Account page. You can
			also designate a co-owner for the identifiers in your account.
		</dd>
		<dt>What is co-ownership?</dt>
		<dd>Co-ownership is when one EZID user account designates
			another EZID user account as co-owner of the first account's
			identifiers. This gives the second EZID user account the right
			to manage and edit detailed information about an identifier.  
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>Create Identifiers</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>Simple create form vs. advanced create form.</dt>
		<dd>In the simple create form, you can create an
			identifier and fill in a brief description of the object
			being identified. In the advanced create form, you have the additional options of adding a custom
			remainder (suffix) to the identifier, the ability to delay
			publishing of identifier, and also the capability to
			select different ways of describing their objects.
		</dd>
		<dt>Which identifier should I choose?</dt>
		<dd>
			DOIs have a brand that is well established in the scholarly
			publishing and archiving world. Use DOIs to register objects
			under good long-term management. DOIs must be accompanied by metadata that conforms to the DataCite Metadata Standard (http://schema.datacite.org/). Researchers may choose a DOI
			for materials being published.
		</dd>
		<dd>
			ARKs have some additional levels of flexibility: they are
			case-sensitive; they can distinguish between special characters
			and adopt predictable behavior; and they can be deleted. Researchers may choose
			to use ARKs during the early stages of a research project and for unpublished materials associated with an
			object that has been registered with a DOI. 
		</dd>
		<dt>Why should I describe my object with metadata?</dt>
		<dd>
			Adding descriptive metadata to an identifier can help
			others find, cite and reuse your object in the future. Metadata
			is information (data) about the object, such as the name
			of the object's creator, the date of creation, the target
			URL, the version of the object, its title, and so on. EZID
			allows you to enter metadata at the same time you request the
			identifier as well as later. If you are creating a DOI, you are required to supply a minimum set of citation metadata specified by DataCite. Clients who wish to enhance the prospects that their metadata will be found, cited and linked to original research are strongly encouraged to submit the Recommended as well as Mandatory set of properties when requesting DOIs.</dd>
<ul>
<li>Creator (The main researchers involved in producing the data, or the authors of the publication)</li>
<li>Title (A name or title by which a resource is known. Should distinguish the resource from others.)</li>
<li>Publisher (The name of the entity that holds, archives, publishes, prints, distributes, releases, issues, or produces the resource.)</li>
<li>PublicationYear (The year when the data was or will be made publicly available.)</li>
</ul>
		<dd>If the completion of any of these fields presents a difficulty, use the following standard (machine-recognizable) codes. However, we recommend that you review the resulting effect on the sample citation created from the metadata provided. This is visible on the Manage page.</dd>
<ul>
<li>(:unac) temporarily inaccessible</li>
<li>(:unal) unallowed, suppressed intentionally</li>
<li>(:unap) not applicable, makes no sense</li>
<li>(:unas) value unassigned (e.g., Untitled)</li>
<li>(:unav) value unavailable, possibly unknown</li>
<li>(:unkn) known to be unknown (e.g., Anonymous, Inconnue)</li>
<li>(:none) never had a value, never will</li>
<li>(:null) explicitly and meaningfully empty</li>
<li>(:tba) to be assigned or announced later</li>
<li>(:etal) too numerous to list (et alia).</li>
<li>(:at) the real value is at the given URL or identifier.</li>
</ul>

An additional piece of metadata is not required, but is highly desirable and a best practice. That is:
<ul><li>ResourceType (the general type of a resource). The options are as follows:</li></ul>

		<dt>What does it mean to publish an identifier?</dt>
		<dd>
			Publication of an identifier means making the identifier,
			its target URL and associate metadata publicly available.
		</dd>
		<dt><b>Advanced create identifier form</b></dt>
		<dd>
			Custom remainders (suffixes) should be unique and opaque. By opaque,
			it is meant that the alphanumeric string has no meaning. EZID
			strongly discourages placing brand strings in the remainder
			because successor organizations do not often honor
			previous brand and name assignments.
		</dd>
		<dd>
			Because it is difficult to do this manually, it is recommended
			that EZID generate new identifiers in order to guarantee that
			they are unique and opaque.  
		</dd>
		<dt>Which citation profile should I use?</dt>
		<dd>
			DataCite Kernel:  when registering a DOI for a dataset,
			the DataCite Kernel is required as a minimum set of metadata.
			If a richer set of descriptive capability is desired, choose the
			full DataCite Schema, which is documented here:
			<a href="http://schema.datacite.org/">http://schema.datacite.org/</a>
		</dd>
		<dd>
			Dublin Core:  the Dublin Core profile is provided for interoperability.
		</dd>
		<dd>
			ERC (aka, Dublin Kernel): the Electronic  Resource Citation
			(ERC) profile is the EZID UI default for ARKs. Metadata
			features developed for the ARK resolver are aimed at records
			stored with this format first. 
		</dd>
		<dd>
			Full DataCite Schema: when registering a DOI for a dataset,
			the DataCite Kernel is required as a minimum set of metadata.
			If a richer set of descriptive capability is desired, choose
			the full DataCite Schema, which is documented here:
			<a href="http://schema.datacite.org/">http://schema.datacite.org/</a>. This must be done via the EZID <a href="/ezid/doc/apidoc.html">API</a>.
		</dd>
		<dt>What is Harvesting and Indexing?</dt>
		<dd>
		Your choice of on or off in the Harvesting/Indexing field pertains to making the metadata available for harvesting and/or indexing. This refers to inclusion in DataCite's Metadata Search store (MDS), which is accessible via an OAI-PMH interface, as well as EZID's metadata store. Third party indexers may access the metadata in these ways. If you choose "on," it does not guarantee that the metadata will be harvested or indexed, but if you choose "off," it removes the possibility. The default setting is "on."</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>Manage IDs</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>How to customize the <i>Manage ID</i> browse list view?</dt>
		<dd>
			You can browse all identifiers that you have
			created by a browse list in the Manage ID section. You
			can customize this list with informational fields of your choice by clicking on the <i>Customize view</i>
			link. You may select up to 8 informational columns for the list view.
		</dd>
		<dt>ID detail view</dt>
		<dd>
			You can view detailed descriptive information
			about identifiers you have created. You'll also see a QR code for the URL version of the identifier. On this screen, you can
			edit and add to the information you have entered into EZID to describe the object.
		</dd>
		<dt>Status</dt>
		<dd>Each identifier in EZID has a status. Status refers to the scope of an identifier's visibility. You can edit the status in the 'About the Identifier' section. The default value is public (visible to anyone). If the status is public, you can change it to unavailable. Also, if the status is public, you can allow or disallow harvesting. Allowing harvesting means making it available for export to external indexing and harvesting services.<br/><br/>Here is a summary of what the status values mean:</dd>
 
<dd><i>public:</i> The default value. Anyone can see a public identifier.</dd>
<dd><i>reserved:</i> The identifier is known only to EZID and visible only by owners. This status may be used to reserve an identifier name within EZID without advertising the identifier's existence to resolvers and other external services. A reserved identifier may be deleted.</dd>
<dd><i>unavailable:</i> The identifier is public, but the object referenced by the identifier is not available. A reason for the object's unavailability may be provided. The identifier redirects to an EZID-provided "tombstone" page (an HTML page that displays the identifier's citation metadata and the reason for the object's unavailability) regardless of its target URL. The page displays the reason provided for its unavailability.</dd>

		<dt>What is a demo identifier?</dt>
		<dd>
			Anyone can try out the EZID functionality without an account by creating
			<i>demo IDs.</i> These identifiers are valid for 2
			weeks and can be used to try out features of the EZID site. 
			Demo identifiers are designated by <span class="fakeid">yellow highlighting</span>
			on the Create IDs and Manage IDs screens.
