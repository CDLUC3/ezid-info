	<h1>About EZID</h1>

<p>
	EZID is a service conceived, built, and maintained by	the	<a href="http://www.cdlib.org/">California Digital Library</a> (CDL). CDL
	was founded by the University of California in 1997 to take
	advantage of emerging technologies that were transforming
	the way digital information was being published and
	accessed. CDL's diverse and talented staff has assembled
	one of the world's largest digital research libraries and
	has changed the ways that faculty, students, and researchers
	discover and access information. 
</p>

<p>
	CDL has relationships with a wide range of
	researchers across the University, including natural history
	museums, research groups, individual scientists and faculty
	members on all 10 UC campuses. CDL staff members bring a
	unique blend of experience to this multi-disciplinary
	venture.  CDL staff members have formal training in science,
	mathematics, the humanities, and information science, as
	well as deep professional experience in the creation of
	software, services, and funded proposals.
</p>


<p>  
	CDL has	extensive contacts with scientists, within the University of
	California and beyond via projects funded by the Library of
	Congress, National Science Foundation, National Institutes
	of Health (pending) and the Gordon and Betty Moore
	Foundation.  More information about CDL's grants and partnerships is <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/about/grants.html">available</a>. Finally, CDL is a founding member of the
	international <a href="http://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a> consortium, which is dedicated to
	providing the social and technical infrastructure that will
	enable data sharing and publication.
