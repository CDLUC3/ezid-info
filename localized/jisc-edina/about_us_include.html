<h1>The EZID-UK Service</h1>

<p>
	EZID is a Jisc service provided via EDINA that allows 
	creators and publishers of data and other digital content 
	to obtain persistent identifiers for their work.  It allows 
	researchers to register their data sets and assign unique, 
	persistent identifiers to them. This makes data easier to 
	locate, identify and cite.
