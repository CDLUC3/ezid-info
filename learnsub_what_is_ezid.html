  <h2 class="heading_2">What is EZID?</h2>
<p>EZID (easy-eye-dee) makes it easy to create and manage long-term, globally unique identifiers for your data and sources, ensuring their future discoverability. Use EZID to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create identifiers for anything: texts, data, bones, terms, etc.</li>
    <li>Manage your research objects more easily with shareable, unbreakable links</li>
    <li>Store citation information for the objects in a variety of formats</li>
    <li>Fit identifiers into your automated workflows with our standards-based API</li> 
  </ul>

  <h2 class="heading_2">Why use EZID?</h2>

  <h3 class="heading_3">Open data, open science, open access initiatives are spreading</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>EZID provides a great way to <strong>promote open sharing</strong>, because it allows the content creator to establish a permanent link to the object.</li>
    <li>When the object gets <strong>cited by others</strong>, even if is moved to a new location, <strong>the citation reference will always work</strong>, as long as the metadata is updated.</li>
    <li>EZID itself is built with open source components, and clients are contributing <a class="link__primary" href="/learn/open_source">open source add-ons</a> as well.</li>
    <li>And now, <a class="link__primary" href="/learn/crossref_faq">EZID is also linked to Crossref</a>, a huge benefit for non-profit open-access publishers that want CrossRef services for their journals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="heading_3">Funders demand management and tracking</h3>
	<ul>
  	<li>The <strong>data management plan will save you time and resources</strong> in the long run and ensure that the data will be usable in the future.</li>
  	<li>Moreover, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf" class="link__primary" title="PDF Document" target="_blank">OSTP Public Access Memo</a> requires an approach to &#34;identifying and providing appropriate attribution to scientific data sets&#34; for covered agency public access plans.</li>
  	<li><strong>EZID services can help.</strong> Contact your university library or one of our <a class="link__primary" href="/learn#02">current clients</a> and <strong>ask for EZID</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
  <h3 class="heading_3">The changing role of the library, with scholarly communication evolving to include data</h3>
	<ul>
  	<li>As your Library develops data management and data curation services, you are looking for ways to <a class="link__primary" href="/learn#06">reach out</a> to scholars and meet their data-related needs.</li>
  	<li><strong>EZID is flexible, affordable and extensible, allowing the Library to sponsor access for all scholars on a campus.</strong></li>
  	<li>The Library can become known as the go-to place for data citation, data sharing, and data management.</li>
	</ul>
  <h3 class="heading_3">Storage has gone global</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You can offer the EZID services to your clients so that they can <strong>register an ARK or DOI now</strong> and circulate and cite the clickable addresses to their colleagues.</li>
    <li>You will appreciate the <strong>automated workflows</strong> available with EZID's easy <a class="link__primary" href="/doc/apidoc.html">application programming interface (API)</a>, its standards-based processes, and the <a class="link__primary" href="/learn#02">growing community of support.</a></li>
  </ul>
